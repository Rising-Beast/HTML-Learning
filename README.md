Learning HTML â€“ documenting my progress with examples and projects.

## Introduction to HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the **basic building blocks** for all websites, allowing you to add `text`, `images`, `links`, `tables`, `forms`, and more. HTML is easy to learn and forms the foundation for web development, working together with CSS and JavaScript to make websites look good and function interactively.

## Relevance Today

HTML is still the **backbone** of every website and web application. No matter how advanced web technologies become, every page on the internet starts with HTML. It ensures content is accessible, structured, and readable by browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies. **Learning HTML is essential for anyone who wants to build or understand websites**.
